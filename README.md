# **Project 1 - Building up your own game or application**
## **FLEX 125, March 5, 2022 - March 19th, 2022**

## **Overview (Eric)**

Your first SEI project will start out with something fun -Â **a game!**

Thanks to the amount of logic there is in a game, there's no better app than a game to teach you how toÂ **think like a programmer**!

Everyone will get a chance toÂ **be creative**, and work through some reallyÂ **tough programming challenges**. You got your feet wet with Tic-Tac-Toe, and we built a game or two during class - now it's time to step it up a notch.

**You will be working individually for this project**. However, your instructors and instructor assistants will be guiding you along with up to ten 15-minute one-on-one sessions. Be sure to use them wisely :).

As a reminder, GA has a zero plagiarism policy - your project's codeÂ **must be substantially yours**.Â **Do not copy code from other similar projects or other sources**. However, using lines of code from StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string.


## **Project Week Format (Will)**

- **Outcomes attendance is mandatory**. If youâ€™re absent for Outcomes that will count as a full day absence, so please show up!
- YouÂ **do not**Â need to submit any exit tickets during project week (ignore the automated Slack reminder)
- You are required to communicate with your teamÂ **daily**Â (on the days we'd normally have class)! This may be in the form of aÂ [daily stand-up](https://geekbot.com/blog/daily-standup-meeting/?k_id=dsa-910872033553&adgroup_id=96910465570&campaign_name_ad=10071775578&gclid=CjwKCAjwzvX7BRAeEiwAsXExo25ZchZ9JOgDt-esFT0qW6Dj36sgBtYkCHLhf-NPH4W7Cw1rKiWhkxoCXVUQAvD_BwE)Â or Standup Message Report. These will occur at 6:30pm ET on Tu/We and 11am ET on Sat in the Main classroom. Only Tuesday 3/8 is required to join for in classroom standups, otherwise you can submit a message report through the form to receive attendance credit for the day.
- Following standups: we'll have several resources to increase your learning and development progress: we'll be opening up study rooms in the main classroom for people to work and help each other out - these are optional and not required. And we'll also have signup for office hours after these standups, see the below section for mroe details.
- Projects must be submitted to theÂ [gallery (via an issue)](https://git.generalassemb.ly/flex-125/project1-gallery/issues)Â by Saturday 3/19 at 8:00 am CST.
- Project presentations will begin at 10:00 am EST on Saturday, 3/19. You must present your project at this time. If you do not show up for project presentations, your project will not be deemed as submitted and you will not be eligible for graduation.
- If you are not able to complete your project by this time, you may request an extension to complete it by 3/26. If you are allowed this extension, you will be required to submit a video recording of yourself presenting the project, as well as a short written page that answers the questions that we will be asking you. Additionally, if your project that you present does not pass the MVP requirements, you will be given one resubmission throughout this course which must be completed with MVP requirements by Saturday, 3/27 and include a video submission of your project.
- There will at times be optional lessons during project weeks held in the main classroom. These are optional (attendance is not marked) and will be recorded and posted. Some topics we'll cover are pushing to github(.com), authoring readmes, deploying apps via github pages. These will be announced on Slack and the class calendar ahead of time.
- Use your section lead and IA to ask any logistical question that come up for you.


### **Office Hours Appointments**

Instructors will be hosting office hours during their regular times each day there is class of the project weeks. These will be based on a Slack signup queue and be 1-1 and maximum 15 min. Try to come as prepared as possible to quickly demonstrate your problem.

> The purpose of this project is for you to show us and future employers what you're capable of, so we want as much of the project to be your own, independent work as possible. For this reason each student will recieve 6 office hours token for individual sessions. Standups, and and logistical

### **Project Proposal**

Create an issue in this repo using theÂ **[Project Proposal**Â issue template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/flex-125/project-1/issues/)Â and submit it before the proposal submission deadline, Saturday, 3/5 at 9 am EST. Make sure you completeÂ **all of the prompts**. Use the example proposal foundÂ [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/flex-125/project-1/blob/master/project_proposal_example.md)Â as a guide.

Your proposal will be reviewed by your Section team who will communicate feedback with you directly.

## **Project Details**

### **ðŸ”´Â Mandatory To Pass:**

### **MVP - Minimum Viable Product**

### **Your application must meet these requirements:**

1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Hosted on Github pages
3. Commits to Github every other day
4. AÂ `README.md`Â file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

# **Project #1: Build a Game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Eric) **

For your first project, you'll be creating a familiar game using HTML, CSS, and JS! You can create your own game or application, or you can select from one of the following:

- **Flash Cards aka "Memory" Game**
- **War**Â (the card game)
- **Trivia **
- **Blackjack**
- **Simon**Â (warning: will require asynchronous timing)
- **2048**
- **Spaceman**
- **Tower of Hanoi**
- **Checkers**Â (no AI required - player vs. player is fine)
- **Solitaire**
- **Battleship**Â (would require a little AI to implement a computer opponent)

The projects above are listed in the approximate order of difficulty from easiest to most challenging. Also, all of the games have numerous potential stretch features that can be worked on in terms of the logic and some of the edge cases that will require a fair amount of thinking.

Projects not from this list must be approved by your Section Team before you begin

This is an opportunity toÂ **be creative** and work through someÂ **tough programming challenges**.

**You will be working individually on this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

Warning - many seemingly simple games end up being much more complex than you might think!

### **ðŸ”µÂ Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):**

Add an API to your project! If you would like to make an App that performs an API call instead of having a game function, you may send in a proposal with your idea to your squad leaders. All of the main project requirements (HTML, CSS, & JS files, daily commits, clean, working code) will still be applied. You may use any free API that you would like. Here is a good list ofÂ [Free Apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

## **Requirements**

Your app must:

- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online usingÂ [Github Project pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Use semantic, valid markup for HTML and CSS (must pass validation without errors)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits (minimum of one commit per project day)

### **Required Deliverables**

This is your project checklist. Make sure to revisit it before you submit your project! Your submission must includeÂ **all**Â of the following:

- A game, built by you, hosted on Github Pages
- A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (**at least one commit is required per class day of the project**).
- AÂ `README.md`Â file that includes the following sections:
    - [ ]  An embedded screenshot of the app
    - [ ]  List of theÂ **Technologies used**
    - [ ]  YourÂ **User stories**Â â€“ who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    - [ ]  YourÂ **Wireframes**Â â€“ sketches of major views/interfaces in your application
    - [ ]  Descriptions of anyÂ **Unsolved problems**Â orÂ **major hurdles**Â you had to overcome
- A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo.


### **Project Submission**

***DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY!***Â Create aÂ **new**Â repository on your PERSONAL GitHub account (not GitHub Enterprise). Then, submit your project as an issue toÂ [the project 1 gallery repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/flex-125/project1-gallery).

You must turn in something before presentations begin. However, you're welcome to continue working on it over the course of SEIR and beyond!

With your submission please include any questions you'd like answered or specific things on which you'd like us to focus when giving feedback.

Once you've submitted your project, make sure to visit your fellow cohort mates' projects. Leave them some encouraging words or ask them about some code they wrote in the comments of their issue!

### **Project Presentations**

It is a common practice on development teams to have a demo day every two weeks at the end of each development cycle (known as a sprint or iteration). On demo day, teams meet to share what they've accomplished during the current sprint.

To prepare you for this, for project 1, you will give a demo of your project to your mega squad. Each person will be given approximately 5-10 minutes to demonstrate their project, talk about some part of their code that they are particularly proud of, share their experiences working on the project, and answer questions from squad members.

You must present your project at this time, even if you did not complete the requirements. If you do not show up for project presentations, your project will not be deemed as submitted and you will not be eligible for graduation.

During presentations, there should beÂ **no working on your code**Â while others are presenting. This is your chance to ask others how they tackled their project.

Be prepared to answer questions like:

- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?


## **Recommendations for Success (David)**

- For those of you who entered GA SEIR as total beginners, think of this as a jumping-off point for you to build and complete something, and look back on it as you continue your growth as a developer. Do not compare yourself to anyone in the class! How complicated or simple anyone else's project is should have no effect on your end product. What matters more is how your projects grow and evolve over the course, not about how yours compares to the person sitting next to you
- This is your first project and you don't have a good way to estimate how long individual tasks will take, there's no problem with under-promising and over-delivering! You can always add more features if time allows. However, if you focus on non-MVP features before your MVP is complete and run out of time, your submission will not satisfy the project requirements.
- **Break the project down into different components**Â (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use a whiteboard or notebook to capture your thoughts! Pseudocoding is going to be a huge part of your planning and time management.
- **Use your Development Tools**Â (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems. Remember though, when you submit your completed project, you will need to delete or comment out these console logs when you submit the finished project.
- **Don't underestimate the value of planning!**Â Use tools likeÂ [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US)Â orÂ [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/)Â and track your progress against milestones. Don't think of the working game as the goal. Think of the next milestone as the goal (e.g., getting my click handler to work, or getting the UI implemented). This will feel far less overwhelming and each successfully completed milestone will provide you with the motivation to tackle the next task!
- **Wireframe**Â Make a drawing of what your app will look like in all of its stages (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once data is retrieved?). You may want to draw these out by hand first, but familiarize yourself with tools such as Abode XD orÂ [https://wireframe.cc/](https://wireframe.cc/). Not only will these technologies be helpful for you in your development and building of the project, but they are also real-world tools that employers will want to see you have some experience with!
- **Commit early, commit often.**Â Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Make it work, make it good, make it fast.**Â Don't get hung up on only saving or writing code that is good code. Get it working first, even if it means writing bad or ugly code. Once it's working, come back and refactor!
- **Consult documentation resources**Â (MDN, etc.) to better understand what youâ€™ll be getting into.
- **Donâ€™t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**Â Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if youâ€™re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you havenâ€™t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## **Timeframes**

Timeframes are key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code and so much to accomplish! Look at all of your planned files and components, and all of the areas of development you are planning and give an estimate of how long each one will take to complete. It's always best to pad the time to account for the unknown, so be sure to add an additional hour or two to play it safe. As you progress, you can update the "Time Invested" column to keep track of your hours, but that number should turn into "Actual Time" by the presentation day. Also, put a winter-themed gif at the top of your readme before you pitch to show you read the instructions thoroughly.

## **Project Schedule**

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

You areÂ **responsible**Â for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day.

## **Plagiarism**

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with theÂ plagiarism policy.

Projects give you an opportunity to apply the skills you're learning in a practical manner. If you're struggling with something, that's okay! In fact, that's why you're here -- if this was easy and you could do it already, you wouldn't be here. These assignments are similar to those you can expect when applying for a job, either in the form of a take-home coding challenge or an in-person technical interview. So lean in, get comfortable with being uncomfortable, and challenge yourself to complete this project on your own.
